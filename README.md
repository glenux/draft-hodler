## Inspirations

* [cryptop](https://github.com/huwwp/cryptop): Nice ncurses UI. Not support for wallet naming, nor trade history.
* [cointop](https://github.com/miguelmota/cointop): Nice ncurses UI & good shortcut keys + README file. Not support for wallet/portfolio.
* [coinwatch](https://github.com/cytopia/coinwatch): Good support for trade history. 100% configuration based. Not support for CEX trade import nor interactive UI.
* [foxfolio](): Nice GUI & options. Heavy browser-based app, not running in terminal. Still unstable.
